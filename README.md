# gymbot

When the University of Delaware was allowed to reopen its gym following the COVID-19 pandemic, access to the gym was based on limited-access time slots that opened 24 hours in advance.
These time slots allowed a select number of people to register to attend the gym at that time.
I wrote this bot to allow me to select any time slot and be automatically signed up for it when the slot had an opening, no matter when I ran the bot.
Since the time slot restrictions have since been dropped, this bot is no longer necessary, however I am leaving it up for posterity.
